# Information Barriers

Microsoft 365 Information Barriers is a feature that allows organizations to restrict communication and collaboration between specific groups of users within their Microsoft 365 environment. This helps to prevent conflicts of interest, protect sensitive information, and comply with regulations and policies.  

Information Barriers can be used in scenarios such as preventing communication between employees who work in different departments or who are involved in different legal matters. Organizations should consider using Information Barriers if they need to enforce strict data governance policies and maintain control over sensitive data within their Microsoft 365 environment.

The GitHub repository provides a guide on how to implement and configure Microsoft 365 Information Barriers using PowerShell commands and roles. The presentation in combination with the session explains the concept of Information Barriers and the different scenarios where they can be applied, such as in legal or compliance matters making it easier for administrators to deploy this feature across their organization.
